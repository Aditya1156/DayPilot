# 🔐 Login Issue - Email Mismatch

## 🚨 Problem Identified

**You're trying to login with the wrong email!**

### What Happened:
1. **Signup:** You registered with `adityaissc7@gamil.com` (typo: "gamil")
2. **Login:** You're trying to login with `adityaissc7@gmail.com` (correct: "gmail")

### Why Login Fails:
```
E/RecaptchaCallWrapper: invalid-credential - The supplied auth credential is incorrect, malformed or has expired.
```

Firebase treats these as **different email addresses**:
- `adityaissc7@gamil.com` ❌ (what you signed up with)
- `adityaissc7@gmail.com` ❌ (what you're trying to login with)

---

## ✅ Solution

### Option 1: Login with the Correct Email (Recommended)

**Use the exact email you signed up with:**
```
Email: adityaissc7@gamil.com  ← Note: "gamil" (typo)
Password: [whatever you used during signup]
```

### Option 2: Create New Account with Correct Email

If you want to use the correct email:
```
1. Switch to "Sign Up" tab
2. Email: adityaissc7@gmail.com  ← Correct spelling
3. Password: [new password]
4. Name: [your name]
5. Sign up
```

## 📊 Your Firebase Users

You have **5 users** in Firebase Auth:

| Email | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| adaityaissc7@gmail.com | ✅ Active | Different account |
| alok1@gmail.com | ✅ Active | Different account |
| alok@gmail.com | ✅ Active | Different account |
| adityaisac7@gmail.com | ✅ Active | Different account |
| **adityaissc7@gamil.com** | ✅ **Your signup** | **Use this to login** |

---

## 🔧 Why This Happens

- Firebase Auth treats emails as unique identifiers
- `gmail.com` vs `gamil.com` are completely different domains
- The typo during signup created a separate account
- Login requires exact email match

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Login with: `adityaissc7@gamil.com`** (with the typo)

The signup worked perfectly - you just need to use the exact email you registered with! 🚀
