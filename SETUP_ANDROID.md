4. Configure build for Android
5. Download APK when built

#### AppCircle

### OPTION 4: Use Windows/Web Version First

Test the app without building APK:

```bash
# Test on Windows
flutter run -d windows

# Test on Web (can access on phone browser)
flutter run -d chrome
```

Then share the web version:
```bash
flutter build web
# Upload the 'build/web' folder to any hosting
# Access on phone via browser
```

   # Build web version
   flutter build web
   
   # Start local server
   cd build/web
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Access on phone browser:
   # http://YOUR_PC_IP:8000
   ```

2. **Best Long-term Solution** (45 minutes):
   - Install Android Studio
   - Build proper APK
   - Full native Android experience

## After Installing Android SDK

Once Android SDK is installed, build commands:

```bash
# Build release APK (recommended for testing)
flutter build apk --release

# Build debug APK (larger, includes debugging)
flutter build apk --debug

# Build split APKs (smallest size)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi --release

# Clean and rebuild (if issues)
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

APK location: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
