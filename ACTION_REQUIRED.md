# 🎯 ACTION REQUIRED: Fix Firebase Connection

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE DETECTED

Your **google-services.json** has the wrong package name!

**Current:** `com.daypilot` ❌  
**Should be:** `com.daypilot.app` ✅

This is why your Firestore database is empty even though Firebase Auth has 4 users!

## ✅ QUICK FIX (5 Minutes)

### **STEP 1:** Go to Firebase Console
1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/pesitm-connect
2. Click **⚙️ (Settings icon)** in top left
3. Select **"Project settings"**

### **STEP 2:** Check Your Apps
Scroll down to **"Your apps"** section

**You'll see one of these scenarios:**

#### **Scenario A:** No Android app registered
```
"There are no apps in your project"
```
→ Click **Android icon** → Register new app

#### **Scenario B:** Android app with wrong package
```
Package name: com.daypilot
```
→ **DELETE this app** (click trash icon)  
→ Then register new app

### **STEP 3:** Register Correct Android App
Click **Android icon** and enter:

```
Android package name: com.daypilot.app
App nickname: DayPilot (optional)
Debug SHA-1: (leave blank for now)
```

Click **"Register app"**

### **STEP 4:** Download google-services.json
1. Click **"Download google-services.json"**
2. **Save the file**
3. **IMPORTANT:** Replace the file at:
   ```
   d:\flutterapp\android\app\google-services.json
   ```

### **STEP 5:** Verify the File
Open the NEW google-services.json and verify it has:
```json
{
  "client": [
    {
      "client_info": {
        "android_client_info": {
          "package_name": "com.daypilot.app"  // ← MUST BE THIS!
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
