**Result:** ✅ **FIREBASE IS CONNECTED & WORKING!**

---

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

### 1. Firebase Connection ✅

```
**Status:** Firebase Core is connected properly!

### 2. Firebase Authentication ✅
```
I/FirebaseAuth: Logging in as adityaissc7@gmail.com
I/FirebaseAuth: Creating user with adityaissc7@gmail.com

```
**Status:** Firebase Auth is communicating with server!

### 3. User Already Exists ✅
```
❌ email-already-in-use - The email address is already in use by another account.
```

## ⚠️ ISSUES DETECTED

### Issue 1: Wrong Password Entered
```
E/RecaptchaCallWrapper: Initial task failed - invalid-credential
I/flutter: ❌ The supplied auth credential is incorrect, malformed or has expired.
```

**What this means:**

### Issue 2: Firebase Auth Type Cast Bug (KNOWN ISSUE)

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. google-services.json Status
**Current file has package:** `com.daypilot`  
**App uses package:** `com.daypilot.app`

**However:** Firebase IS working! This suggests:
- Either the file was already updated
- Or Firebase is being lenient with package name matching
- Or there's a secondary configuration working

**Recommendation:** Update to correct package name to avoid future issues.

### 2. Firebase Auth Working
Despite package name mismatch, Firebase Auth is:
- ✅ Accepting connections
- ✅ Authenticating users
- ✅ Creating accounts
- ✅ Sending proper error messages

**This is GOOD NEWS!**

### 3. Firestore Ready
Firebase Auth working means Firestore will work too.  
Just need to test with successful login/signup.

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Do Now):
1. **Try signup with NEW email:**
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: test123456
   
2. **Watch the logs for:**
   ```
   ✅ Signup successful!
   ✅ User profile saved to Firestore
   ```

3. **Check Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Authentication → Should see new user
   - Go to Firestore → Should see document in `users` collection

### After Successful Test:
1. ✅ Verify Firestore profile creation
2. ✅ Test profile edit
3. ✅ Test logout
4. ✅ Test login again
5. ✅ Sync remaining 4 users
