# 🔍 Signup-Firestore Debug Analysis

## 📊 What I Observed from Logs

### ✅ **Signup Successfully Created Users**

From the logs, I can see **2 new users were created**:

1. **test@example.com**
   - UID: `INLf4yh4HKclIjtyeksFlUk9ilj1`
   - ✅ Firebase Auth: User created successfully
   - ❓ Firestore: Status unknown (debugging logs missing)

2. **alok@gmail.com**
   - UID: `iguSTOPJnKdMzas1s33dhoK3oe73`
   - ✅ Firebase Auth: User created successfully
   - ❓ Firestore: Status unknown (debugging logs missing)

### 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The **firebase_auth plugin bug** is causing the code to exit early before reaching the Firestore save code:

```
D/FirebaseAuth: Notifying auth state listeners about user ( INLf4yh4HKclIjtyeksFlUk9ilj1 )
I/flutter: ⚠️ Known firebase_auth plugin bug (non-critical): type 'List<Object?>' is not a subtype...
I/flutter: 🔄 Resetting loading state
```

**The detailed debugging logs I added are NOT appearing**, which means the signup process is being interrupted by the plugin bug before reaching the Firestore save section.

## 🎯 **Root Cause**

The issue is in the **order of operations**. The firebase_auth plugin bug is causing an exception that prevents the Firestore save code from executing, even though the user account is successfully created.

**Current Flow:**
1. ✅ `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` succeeds
2. ❌ `updateDisplayName()` throws plugin bug exception
3. 🚫 **Firestore save code never reached**
4. ⚠️ Exception caught by generic handler
5. 🔄 Loading state reset, process ends

---

## 🔧 **Solution Required**

We need to **restructure the signup flow** to ensure Firestore save happens **before** the problematic `updateDisplayName()` call.

**New Flow Should Be:**
1. ✅ `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` succeeds
2. ✅ **Save to Firestore IMMEDIATELY** (before any other Firebase Auth operations)
3. ✅ Save to SharedPreferences
4. ⚠️ Try `updateDisplayName()` (may fail, but that's OK)
5. 🎉 Complete signup successfully

---

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Restructure signup code** to save Firestore data immediately after user creation
2. **Move updateDisplayName to the end** so it can't block Firestore save
3. **Add try-catch around individual operations** instead of wrapping the entire process
4. **Test with new account** to verify Firestore document creation

---

## 💡 **Technical Insight**

The users are being created in Firebase Auth successfully, but the plugin bug is preventing the completion of the signup flow, which includes the Firestore profile creation. This explains why you see users in Authentication but no documents in Firestore.
